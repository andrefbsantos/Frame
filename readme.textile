h2. Project setup

All projects must have a git repository by codebase, continuous integration, automated code review, and use virtual machines for development.

h3. Virtual machines: We use Vagrant with Ansible

h4. Install VirtualBox

pre. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

pre. https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

h4. Install Vagrant

pre. https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

h4. Install Ansible (mac)

pre. $ brew install ansible


h3. Look for configuration examples on the "vagrant_ansible_examples":vagrant_ansible_examples folder

To try the examples, just copy the files from the example you choose to your project base folder and do:


* Start the machine (The first time it will take some minutes to load everything)

pre. $ vagrant up

Note: Sometimes (depending of the Vagrantfile configuration, the script might ask you for your host machine password. This only happens if a private network and NFS shared folders are configured on the Vagrantfile.
This is a good practice for bigger projects because it speeds up the disk access on the shared folders.

If all goes well, you should now be able to access the guest machine services on the localhost port or private IP defined on the "Vagrantfile" 
To access the machine via ssh you can do:

pre. $ vagrant ssh

Now you can see that the "/vagrant" folder of the machine is in sync with yout base project folder on the host machine. 


* Stop the machine

pre. $ vagrant halt


* Destroy the machine

pre. $ vagrant destroy




h2. Go Live

*a paragraph about the importance of goint live*

Denpeding if it is a web project, a mobile project or both, several actions need to be taken into account before going live.

Here is a list of the most relevant ones:

h3. Web applications

For Web applications, the following list is important:

* Setup meta information
** For search engines consider at least <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description" target="_blank">meta description</a> and <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag" target="_blank">title</a>
** For social networks consider at least og:title, og:url, og:description and og:image, as seen here <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices" target="_blank">here</a>. The result can be tested <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/" target="_blank">here</a>, and the guidelines for og:image can be seen <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/best-practices#images" target="_blank">here</a>.

h3. Setup Exception Notification with Redmine
